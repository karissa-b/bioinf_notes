## Downloading 10X genomics data from sra to HPC

Trying out this blog thing, so pls be nice 


First, obtain the data you want from sra run selector. you can filter the dataset to select the particular samples you want.

For the samples you want, you need to download a txt file with the accessions you want to analyse. this is done in the select part of the sra run selector.

the file should look something like this

```
karissabarthelson@Karissas-MacBook-Pro:$ head sra.txt
SRR32125183
SRR32125184
SRR32125185
SRR32125186
SRR32125187
```

put this file in the working directory of the HPC. 

if your HPC has internet access on the compute nodes, probs should let the compute node do it. but some HPCs dont have  access to the internet on the server, so just do it on the login/head node. 

next, we should prefetch the data. this is faster than running fastq-dump. 

```
# prefetch the sra data
prefetch --option-file sra.txt

# loop over the SRA IDs in sra.txt to extract the fq files
# make sure to change to -O to the relevant outdir
while read -r SRA_ID; do
    echo "Processing $SRA_ID"
    fastq-dump --split-files --gzip "${SRA_ID}/${SRA_ID}.sra" -O "/path/to/folder/01_rawdata/fastq"
done < sra.txt
```

Now you have the fastq files. However, they are named in this convention: 

```
SRR32125230_1.fastq.gz
SRR32125230_2.fastq.gz
SRR32125230_3.fastq.gz
SRR32125230_4.fastq.gz
```

Cellranger needs the files to be named in this way:

<SampleName>_S<SampleNumber>_L00<Lane>_<Read>_001.fastq.gz

When we look at the run in SRA, we see 4 reads per sample
